🏛️#Colonial Tomb Archive ID
Collaborative GIS Hub for Colonial Chinese Tombs Indonesia (KITLV Open Data)
⚠️ ETHICAL DISCLAIMER: This project is dedicated to historical research and cultural preservation. Users are strictly urged to use this spatial data wisely and ethically. High-precision data is intentionally avoided to prevent misuse that could threaten the physical integrity or sanctity of these heritage sites.

🌟 Project Vision
This repository is a decentralized collaborative hub designed to detect and document the spatial footprint of colonial-era Chinese cemeteries in Indonesia. By bridging the gap between KITLV Public Domain archives and modern GIS technology, we transform forgotten maps into active tools for cultural preservation.

📍 The GIS Workflow
We leverage GitHub as an infrastructure to manage spatial data under a collaborative "Open Science" framework:

🗺️ Archival Integration: Rectifying public domain maps from the KITLV collection into modern coordinate systems.

📊 Spatial Standardization: Converting unstructured archival metadata into machine-readable GeoJSON, KML, and CSV formats.

🕰️ Spatiotemporal Analysis: Tracking the evolution of cemetery landscapes against modern urban expansion.

🛡️ Responsible Accuracy: Prioritizing distribution patterns over high-precision coordinates to safeguard vulnerable sites from looting or vandalism.

💎 The FAIR Data Commitment
This project is built on the FAIR Principles to ensure the longevity of digital heritage:

FINDABLE: Metadata is indexed with permanent KITLV Handle URLs for easy discovery.

ACCESSIBLE: Built entirely on Public Domain and Open Access source materials from Leiden University.

INTEROPERABLE: Data is provided in open formats compatible with QGIS, ArcGIS, and Web-GIS.

REUSABLE: Documented workflows allow for scientific peer review and further research expansion.

📂 Source Material (KITLV Public Domain)
We exclusively utilize open-access assets to ensure transparency:

Historical Cartography: 19th-century city plans and Sentiong (cemetery) layouts.

Topographic Prints: Visual records used for site context and architectural styles.

Archival Metadata: Standardized records of interred figures and historical eras.

🤝 How to Contribute
Heritage preservation is a collective responsibility. You can contribute by:

Validating Data: Cross-checking archival sites with non-sensitive satellite imagery.

Georeferencing: Helping to align Public Domain maps to their historical locations.

Refining Metadata: Improving the descriptions and historical context of mapped points.
