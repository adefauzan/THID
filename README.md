# RCTCI
The primary objective is to transform static, historical records into a dynamic, open-access spatial database. This allows researchers and the public to visualize the evolution of Tionghoa funerary landscapes, many of which are currently threatened by rapid urbanization and land-use changes.

📍 GIS-Centric Collaboration
Using GitHub as a technical infrastructure, this project facilitates a "crowdsourced" approach to heritage science. Our workflow focuses on:

Georeferencing & Digitization: Converting high-resolution Public Domain maps and colonial-era city plans from the KITLV collection into georeferenced raster layers.

Vector Data Creation: Extracting specific tomb locations and cemetery boundaries to create standardized GeoJSON, KML, and Shapefiles.

Spatiotemporal Tracking: Comparing historical cartography with modern satellite imagery to monitor the preservation status of these sites over time.

Version Control for Heritage: Every update to a site’s coordinates or metadata is tracked via Git commits, ensuring a transparent and reproducible record of our mapping progress.

📂 Utilizing KITLV Public Domain Data
This project exclusively utilizes KITLV materials that have entered the Public Domain, ensuring that our outputs remain part of the global Open Data movement. Key sources include:

Historical Cartography: 19th and 20th-century maps of Batavia, Semarang, and Surabaya.

Topographic Prints: Visual records providing architectural context for "Omega-shaped" and traditional Hokkien tombs.

Archival Metadata: Machine-readable descriptions used to categorize tombs by era and prominence.

🛠️ Contributing to Open Heritage
We invite GIS specialists, historians, and digital humanists to contribute. Whether through verifying coordinates, georeferencing new maps, or cleaning metadata, your input helps preserve a crucial part of Indonesia’s multicultural history.

“Preserving the past through open collaboration and spatial precision.”
